# liri

# Problem 
Liri will allow the user to look up bands, movies and music based on their user input. It will save the user time from having to look it up. 

# Structure

This application takes in 4 commands and user input (ie. band names, songs, and movies). It used the commands to call specific functions in order to effectively gather data on the users input. 

# Tutorial: 

### Step one: 
type in a command. They can be any of the following: 
concert-this , spotify-this-song , movie-this , do-what-it-says 

See images below: 
concert-this command

spotify-this-song command 
![SPOTIFYCOMMAND] (https://github.com/lmd808/liri/blob/master/images/spotifycommand.png)
movie-this command

do-what-it-says command
![DOWHATCOMMAND] (https://github.com/lmd808/liri/blob/master/images/dowhatcommand.png)

### Step Two: 
type in an input. The concert-this command take in a parameter of a band name or artist. The spotify-this-song  command takes in a parameter of a song. The movie-this command takes in a parameter of a movie title. Finally, the do-what-it-says command does not take a parameter. It will read the random.txt file. NOTE: THE PARAMETERS MUST BE IN QUOTATIONS!!!
